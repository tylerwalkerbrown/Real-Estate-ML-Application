# Real-Estate-ML-Application
 
For this project I will be using rapidapi Zillow api to create a dynamic ensemble learning project using unsupervised ML clustering, regression and classification. The general idea of the project is to cluster based on geo-spatial areas and run regression and classification models to boost prediction accuracy. After the ensemble model is created least squares will be used as a threshold to rate the deal of the property. After model is complete I will turn it into a flask application with some basic funtionality.
